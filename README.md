Enemy airplanes  fall from each sector: 
  Enemy airplanes are given different amount of energy and graphics according to their types.
  They fall consistently from 3 sectors and when they reach the bottom, they disappear,
  and they make player lose energy. 
  

Player is given initial energy.
  It shoots enemy airplanes using space key and moves around usig direction keys (2D).
  It cannot move up or down.
 Â Its graphic representation is a tank which can shoot at the airplanes.
  Its initial energy is given by 1000. 
  When it loses energy, the remaining energy text in the stats bar decrease by that amount.
  If its energy reaches zero, the game is over and the status bar changes into GAMEOVER
  instead of play.
